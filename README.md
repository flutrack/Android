##Tips for using the app with Eclipse or Android Studio
If you want to import the project to Android Studio follow [these instructions](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/migrate.html), otherwise for importing it to Eclipse Select Import -> Existing Android Code Into Workspace. In both cases ensure that you have the latest version of google play services installed. If you do not have the google play services installed Select Window > Android SDK Manager. Scroll to the bottom of the package list and Select Extras > Google Play services. The Google Play services SDK is installed in your Android SDK environment at <android-sdk-folder>/extras/google/google_play_services/.

**Extra step for Eclipse**: After downloading google play services Click File -> Import..., Select Android -> Existing Android Code into Workspace, browse to and Select <android-sdk-folder>/extras/google/google_play_services/libproject/google-play-services_lib.
    
If after importing the project Eclipse or Android Studio do not recognize the APIs that the google play services library provides:


1. For Eclipse :To add the dependency to Google Play Services into the project go to Project -> Properties -> Android -> Library, Add -> google-play-services_lib.


2. For Android Studio: Go to File -> Project Structure -> Select 'Project Settings' -> Select 'Dependencies' Tab Click '+' -> 1.Library Dependencies -> Select com.google.android.gms:play-services:+.
        Alternatively you can import the library by modifying the build.gradle file inside your application module directory. Add a new build rule under dependencies for the latest version of play-services. For example:
        
```
dependencies {
    compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:21.0.3'
    compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services:6.5.87'
}
```
   
After the project is successfully built change the empty string values (url2, url) located inside the fluMap and reportSymptoms fragments with the URLs for the get_json.php and submit_flu.php files.

Unless you are using an Android Emulator, you need a device that can run at least **Android 4.0 (Api Level: 14)**.
