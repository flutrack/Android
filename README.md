##Guide for importing and using the app through Android Studio
The app was developed in Eclipse. If you are using Android studio follow [these instructions](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/migrate.html) in order to successfully import it. 

In the fluMap and reportFlu fragments replace the empty values with the urls for the get_json.php and submit_flu.php files.

Unless you are using an Android Emulator, make sure that your device can run at least Android 4.0 (Api Level: 14).
